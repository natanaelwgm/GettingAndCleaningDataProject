# Getting and Cleaning Data Project
## Introduction

This Codebook will explain the variables contained in the tidy dataset as well as in the resulting data of the run_analysis.R code that is located in this repository.

## How was the initial dataset?
The dataset was adopted from the UCI HAR Dataset. Initially, the dataset was quite messy and really hard to read. However, after a period of digesting the data, we can infer that there are similarities across the datasets contained in the data. 

It initially contained the datasets such as:
* features  
* features_info  
* activity_labels  
* X_train  
* X_test  
* y_train  
* y_test  
* subject_test  
* subject_train  
* README  

as well as inertia files for both testing and training dataset (but we will not delve into them)
